# Manifold_Final
Manifold.co latency reduction project

This project focuses on reducing latency by co-locating applications that frequently interact on the same server.

This used a publically available dataset from https://www.hs-coburg.de/index.php?id=927

The modules are used to run the Apriori algorithm and also assign apps to specific servers. All modules must be in the directory, but only the 'assign_test_apriori.py' script will be explicitly called (the other modules are called from that module).
